Used Facebook prophet to create a predictive model!

Facebook Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. 
It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data
